1) Find the mean and standard deviation of the 3 variables AnnualSalary, GrossPay, and YearsWorked for each job title.
1) Using the mean and standard deviation, find the z-scores for the 3 variables using the standardize formula. 
1) Select all the data points including the following: Job # sequence, JobTitle, AgencyName, YearsWorked, AnnualSalary, and correlating z-scores. Name it “cluster” 
1) Create an anchor table with 3 anchor points that include the job #, JobTitle, and z scores. 
1) Find the distance squared from the z-scores in the anchor table from the z-scores in the “cluster” data set. 
1) Find the minimum distance between the three distances and separate it in another column.
1) Calculate the minimum sum.
1) Match anchor number for all the job titles.
